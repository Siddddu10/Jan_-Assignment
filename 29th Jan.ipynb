    "Q1.Who developed Python Programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s while he was\n",
    "working at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the \n",
    "Netherlands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2.Who developed Python Programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-Python is a general-purpose programming language that supports several programming paradigms,\n",
    "including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Procedural programming: Writing programs using a series of procedures or functions that are \n",
    "executed in a specific order to perform a specific task.\n",
    "2)Object-oriented programming (OOP): Writing programs using objects that interact with each\n",
    "other to perform a specific task.\n",
    "3)Functional programming: Writing programs using functions that are treated as first-class \n",
    "citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions and returned as values.\n",
    "4)Aspect-oriented programming (AOP): Writing programs using aspects that modify the behavior of\n",
    "other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3.Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-Yes, Python is a case-sensitive programming language when dealing with identifiers such as\n",
    "variable names, function names, class names, and module names. This means that identifiers with\n",
    "different capitalization are considered to be different and separate from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4.What is a correct extension python file\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-In Python, the correct file extension for a Python source code file is .py.This is the\n",
    "standard file extension used by Python, and it is recognized by most Python development tools \n",
    "and environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5.Is python code compiled or interpreted\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-Python is an interpreted programming language, which means that Python code is executed \n",
    "directly by an interpreter, line by line, without the need for compilation to machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6.Name a few blocks of code used to define in python language\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-In Python, you can define blocks of code using indentation. The most common types of blocks in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Function blocks: These are blocks of code that define a function. They start with the def \n",
    "keyword and are followed by the function name and its arguments, and a colon. The code inside \n",
    "the function block is indented and defines the behavior of the function\n",
    "2)Loop blocks: These are blocks of code that define loops. They can be created using the for or\n",
    "while keywords followed by a colon. The code inside the loop block is indented and is executed \n",
    "repeatedly as long as the loop condition is true.\n",
    "3)Conditional blocks: These are blocks of code that define conditional statements. They can be \n",
    "created using the if, elif, and else keywords followed by a colon. The code inside the \n",
    "conditional block is indented and is executed only if the condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7.State a character used to give single line comments in python\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-#\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8.Mention function which can help us to find the version of python we are currently working on\n",
    "Ans-sys.version\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9.Pythons supports the creation of anonymous function at runtime using a construct called \n",
    "\"Lambda Function\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10.What does pip stand for\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-In Python, pip stands for \"Pip Installs Packages\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Q11.Mention a few built in functions in python\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-Here are some of the most commonly used built-in functions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(): Prints the specified message to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "len(): Returns the length (number of items) of an object.\n",
